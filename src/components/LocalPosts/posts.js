        "content" : "Description: External Virtual Memory Storage and Informational Architecture for embedded version of human brain.Problem/Purpose:Address the situation  of extreme amount of memorized information, speed of retrievement of information, accuracy of retrievement.Note:It is not a search engine and it does not work the same way. This Model allows people to retrieve information through association and internal personal connection, control the path of what type of information they want to retrieve using certain structure and UIInteraction:VR Room Experience. Discussion Even if this concept may seem delusional it contains one of the ideas how tech can make human bodies to be more advanced in their skills. I have not explored a lot of ways how it can be implemented in someoneâ€™s life easily in the current state of the world. Although. One of the ways how it will be stored and working is a holographic storage of information and projection. Nevertheless, this exploration still be in process. As the next step for improvement, I started to think about the connection of this with machine learning for personalized experiences, and dived deeper into acknowledgement with neurobiology and psychology.Additional:How to access infoHow to retrieve info (projected room: make a mock up + possible holographic thing)Structure (describe better)Skills: Space oriented interfaces, Environment. Projected Interfaces. Holography. Information"
